<h3>What’s New?</h3>
<p>These are my most recent works of art and reflect new ideas, experimentation, and the continuation of some past themes. I joined an art group recently and have been using my iPad to make sketches of models – that’s new!  Some of these sketches have been transformed into oil portraits. Many of my works portray places I have traveled, but lately my backyard and its surrounds have provided me with new inspiration without going far. Luckily, I live in a beautiful place.</p>
