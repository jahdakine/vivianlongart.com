<h3>Sky Series</h3>
<p>
Winiger Ridge Sky Series is a series of 20+ pastel paintings of the same view of sky at different times of day and year. The titles refer to the month and the time, in 24 hour configuration, so August 1830 means it was an August sky at 6:30pm. The sky scenery shifts dramatically second by second, in contrast to the landscapeâ€™s slower and more subtle changes.

<em>These works are painted on acid free archival paper board, prepared to accept the pastel pigments.

The sky series paintings float in their frames, with stained glass pieces floating around them. Some are available unframed, or can be framed, as you choose.</em>
