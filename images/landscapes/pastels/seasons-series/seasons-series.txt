<h3>Seasons Series</h3>
<p>
I get excited every time a new season rolls around. The thrill of that first bud of spring, or the particular shade of chartreuse green that only appears in new vegetation, gives way to long summer days with blue skies, thunderclouds, and a profusion of wildflowers and the chance to venture forth on long hikes. I love fall with the glorious colors of leaves and grasses, especially when it stretches into Indian summer. The first blanket of snow changes the world; everything is softened, shapes change, and white is, of course, all colors, so my palette can expand. I admit winter lasts longer than I care for, my excitement wanes, and I long for spring again.

<em>I use a glowing water color under-painting overlaid with the pure pigment of pastels to create rich, vibrant colors. These works are painted on rag paper, or acid free archival paper board and often framed in inlaid hardwood frames, designed for each painting.</em>
