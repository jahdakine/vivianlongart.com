<h3>Dreams and Stories</h3>
<p>
Every picture tells a story&hellip;
</p>

<p>
These paintings come from my dreams, stories I’ve read, and stories I’ve invented. Dreams and fleeting images are brought to life with paint. Emotions are caught and locked in pigment. While I could try to explain every image, it would probably bore you, or have no meaning. These are visual stories and are best interpreted by you, the viewer, through your inherent biases, experiences, ideals, and vision.  Any words used to explain the images and my thoughts about them can only corrupt the innocence of your perception of the art. While we may look for guides to help us understand life, often the best adventures and the most edifying are those through which we have found our own way.
