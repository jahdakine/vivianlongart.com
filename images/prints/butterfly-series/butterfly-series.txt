<h3>Butterfly Series</h3>
<p>Read the text on the <a class="content" href="butterfly-series.php">Butterfly Series</a> page for information on the creation of this series.

Thinking about the title of the series and their similarity to butterflies, I created a second line of prints, with multiple prints.  Some present one image in different sizes, others have different images in different sizes. I have used pins to mount the images, much as butterflies are presented. I have also given them Latin names to complete the resemblance. Or you can think of them as the ultimate pin up girls.

This also seemed the right place to show the images of the single matted, or matted and framed Butterfly Series limited edition prints, which you can also purchase from the Butterfly Series page. The originals are matted and framed in an identical manner to the single prints, so you can get a better idea of the finished product by looking at a few samples here.

The multiple series prints have one signed limited edition print included with the smaller unsigned prints.
