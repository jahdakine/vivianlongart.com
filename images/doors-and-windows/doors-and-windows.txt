<h3>Doors and Windows</h3>
<p>This is a series of paintings about our openings: welcoming, forbidding, grand, dilapidated, simple, elegant, and functional. How do we view the world through the framework of our architecture and what do others understand about us by the characteristics of our portals? We build walls and then make openings in those walls; how we do it tells volumes about us. How the artist interprets them tells another story, for the viewer to decipher.
