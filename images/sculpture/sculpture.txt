<h3>Sculpture</h3>
<p>
Delve into the fantastic, intricate wood carvings, or multi-media wall sculptures, and you will find stories, or, perhaps, serious concepts. Of course, it is your task to figure out those tales, or weave meaning into them. Take your time and explore all their aspects.

<em>Materials used are wood, paint, pastels, copper, silver, glass, barbed wire, non-barbed wire, enameled copper, fabric, feathers, and found objects. I have favorite materials, but I am unprejudiced and will use whatever comes to hand, if it will meet my objectives.</em>
