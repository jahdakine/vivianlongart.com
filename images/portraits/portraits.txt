<h3>Portraits</h3>
<p>
As Aristotle stated, "The aim of Art is to present not the outward appearance of things, but their inner significance; for this, not the external manner and detail, constitutes true reality." One hopes, with a portrait, that not only the inner essence of the subject will be portrayed, but some likeness, as well.

<em>These portraits are executed in either oil paints on archival panel, or pastels on 100% rag paper, or archival panels. I happily accept commissions for portraits of people or animals.</em>
