<h3>Still Life</h3>
<p>
A portrait of inanimate objects. "With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Greek/Roman art, still life paintings give the artist more leeway in the arrangement of design elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture." &mdash; Wikipedia.

Occasionally I paint still life compositions. It provides an opportunity to control all aspects of the artwork, including subject, composition, colors, lighting, and time (to some extent- as flowers wilt and fruit rots). Sometimes it is a meditative process and other times a challenge.
