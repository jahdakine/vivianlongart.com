While one can capture an image in an instant, with the click of the shutter, getting the right image depends on a bit more thought & planning. Think about where the light is, whether it will be better later, where you need to be to get the shot you want, and more.

While I love scenic vistas, I really love getting into details, exploring textures, contrasts, and the juxtaposition of man-made with natural elements. I play with patterns and light to make the usual extraordinary.
