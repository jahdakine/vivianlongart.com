<h3>Jewelry</h3>
<p>
These jewelry pieces are one of a kind, not mass produced. Therefore, the specific pieces you view here may, or may not be available, but can be considered representative samples of my work. Please feel free to contact me to purchase a piece, or to request a commission for a similar piece.

I enjoy the repetitive, meditative process of making hand-made chain, but it is certainly more labor intensive than those made by machines. I like to leave the signs that show it is handmade, so there are tool marks, not every link is identical, nor do I polish to a high gloss.

Jewelry pieces with stones are unique, as I cut and polish the stones for each piece. Sometimes I cut a stone for a particular idea. Other times I arrange a few cut stones in front on me and let the stones suggest their own paths for design. All stones are different, so every piece is different.
