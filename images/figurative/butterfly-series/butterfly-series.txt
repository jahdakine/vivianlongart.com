<h3>Butterfly Series</h3>
<p>The Butterfly Series is comprised of small (4.5”X 5”), colorful watercolor studies of the female body. These paintings were originally intended to be studies for the Nude Series of moderately large (30” to 40”) oil paintings in hand carved frames. Although some of the studies have been transformed into the larger series, I took a second look at these studies and continued exploring the idea of small figurative watercolors. Why title it the ‘Butterfly Series’? These small paintings are fragmentary views of the female form, in vivid colors, which mounted in a large matte, are reminiscent, to me, of mounted butterflies, simultaneously exquisite, fragile, and h3, like women.
