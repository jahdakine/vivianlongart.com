<h3>Nude Series</h3>
<p>
These oil paintings are fragmentary views of the female form, meant to explore our emotions, views of propriety, and societal stereotypes. There are multiple layers of meanings in my works of art. What is beauty? Can you separate the beauty of the image from the content of that image? Will the simple beauty of the artwork draw the viewer in to further contemplate the image?  The premise of the unusual colors in this series is to make representational paintings seem somewhat unrealistic, which allows the viewer to look at the shapes, curves, and muscles and see the beauty, grace, and power of the women.

<em>The hand carved hardwood frames for these paintings are not just containers for the artwork; they are an integral component. The paintings are on archivally prepared panels.</em>
