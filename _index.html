		 		<h2>Artworks</h2>
				<p>This online gallery represents the work of the artist, Vivian Long. The slides show samples of all of the different media and styles of art you will see in this website. You will find richly colored and textured paintings in pastels and oils, dreamy watercolors, elaborate mixed media sculptures, and intricate wood carvings. Art is a form of communication between artist and viewer. With these works, I lay open my mind and inner feelings to you. Explore the site and I hope you enjoy my artwork, as much as I enjoy creating it. If you like it, please share the link with others.</p>
