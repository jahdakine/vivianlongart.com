					<h2>The Artist</h2>
					<p>Vivian Long started with finger paints at age four. The compulsion and desire to create grew and so she has pursued a life in art. Although educated in fine and commercial arts, she is primarily self-taught and is continually embracing new forms of expression. her work has been selected to show and awarded prizes in many juried shows within the USA.</p>
					<p><em>"Growing up in Louisiana and then Colorado, I ran wild in the swamps and found exhileration on mountain peaks. That gave me plenty of time to examine minutia: the patterns of duckweed on water, or lichens on rock, and to glory in broad vistas. I have always been drawn to contrasts and that is reflected in my art. Since childhood, I have felt compelled to create art with whatever materials came to hand. I work with a variety of media, as their distinctive qualities contribute to the mood, or effect, I wish to achieve. Each tells a different story. While many of my works portray the phisical world&nbsp;around us, the places I've traveled, the landscape I live in, other pieces&nbsp;reflect the interior world of my imagination, and all are affected by the people I've met, friends, and family".</em></p>
					<p>Vivian lives near Boulder, in the foothills of Colorado, with her husband, dog, chickens, and a variety of wildlife.</p>

		 		<h2>The Creative Process</h2>
				<p>The creative process starts with an idea, or inspiration, sometimes drawn from nature, sometimes from dreams, music, or stories, or from the complications of modern life. I work with a variety of media, as their distinctive qualities contribute to the mood I wish to achieve; they each tell a different story. The process from this point will vary according to medium and subject, but I have put together a storyboard of the process for the sculpture “Bathing With Frogs”, as an example.</p>
