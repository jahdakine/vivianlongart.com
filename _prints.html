<h2>Limited Edition Prints</h2>
<p><strong>What are these</strong> and how do they differ from prints on demand? There are two types of limited edition prints: those made from an artist's etched plate, or screen design, and those made via photographic reproduction. These are the latter &ndash; reproduction prints of painted art works. Modern technology has changed the process considerably. Numbered prints got their start as the reasonable number of prints that could be produced from a printing plate before it was too worn to be accurate. The first prints were considered more valuable, because the plate was newer, with more detail. Digital technology allows infinite copies, with every copy of equal quality, but artists still usually produce a finite number of prints in any edition to enhance value.</p>
<p>So, <strong>why is this different</strong> from the prints from Zazzle? With a limited edition print, the artist ensures that the photograph of the painting is of the highest quality, not an easy task, as it requires lighting to control reflection and enhance detail. Then, in collaboration with the printer, proofs are made to tweak the print until the colors and details are as close to the original as possible (they will never equal that of the original painting, as paint on a surface reflects light in ways that a print cannot). Once the artist is satisfied that the proof is correct, then the printing begins. The <strong>Gicl&eacute;e</strong> (high resolution, archival ink) prints are produced on acid free archival paper. Each print is carefully inspected to ensure quality is maintained and duly signed and numbered by the artist. No more prints are pulled in that edition than are stipulated by the artist's limit for the edition.</p>

<h2>Prints</h2>
<p>These are "prints on demand", offered by a service such as Zazzle, or FineArtAmerica, etc. The artist provides a quality photograph of the art work and the service reproduces it in sizes stipulated by the artist, in prints, cards, or on other gifts. The hope is that the print will come close to matching the work of art, but there is not the same oversight, as with the limited edition prints, to guarantee matching the original. You may like it just as well in its new reincarnation, even if it isn't exactly as expected. Of course, if you are dissatisfied, you may return the print.</p>
<p><em>Be aware that different computer screens show colors differently, so don't expect an exact match to your screen with any print, or original</em>.</p>
