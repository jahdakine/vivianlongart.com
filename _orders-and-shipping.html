        		<strong>If you are in a hurry</strong>, or want a less expensive alternative, there are prints on demand through <a class="content" href="http://www.zazzle.com/vivianlongart_prints/gifts" target="_blank">Zazzle</a>. Their ordering, shipping, and return policies are as stated on their website. <em>For the difference between Prints on demand and Limited Edition prints see the <a class="content" href="prints.php">Print Editions</a> page</em>.
					</li>
					<li>
		        <strong>Limited Edition Prints take a bit longer</strong>. In the past an edition of 25 was made in one run, the artist paid for them, and hoped to sell them all. These days they are printed one, or several at a time and the edition count is closely monitored by the printer and the artist to ensure the limit is not exceeded.  This keeps costs down for everyone. I may have a print on hand, or I may have to get the printer to print yours. This means I could have it flying your way the day after I receive payment, or it may take up to a week to ship it (depending on the printerâ€™s schedule). I will try to send you an email notification with probably delivery time.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Original artwork is best purchased by contacting the artist</strong>. Details of the art purchase and shipping can be worked out and personalized. If you wish to see additional photos of the artwork, or determine the exact size that can also be taken care of this way. Once the details are finalized, you will be invoiced through PayPal, with one payment for the art and shipping.
					</li>
					<li id="damage">
		        <strong>Originals also take a bit more time</strong>, mostly due to packaging requirements. Some originals require more work than others to package. Very large pieces have to be crated; pastels cannot be shipped with glass, but must have the surface protected from packaging materials to prevent damage. Pastels are gorgeous, but are more fragile, and require extra efforts to keep them safe.
					</li>
					<li>
		        <strong>Please bear in mind that this is not a factory; every order is processed by the artist</strong>. If I am traveling, sick, or otherwise out of touch when your order comes in, there may be a delay in processing the order. I will do my best to inform you of any delays, but there may be occasional times when I am not available by phone, or email. Be assured I will attend to your order as soon as possible.
					</li>
					<li>
	          <strong>It is your option to have watercolors, or framed prints shipped with, or without glass</strong>. I recommend without glass, as it adds weight and increases the cost of shipping and there is a high probability the glass will get broken, possibly damaging the art (although I do my best to prevent this).

 			<ul class="indent">
 				<li>
     			Shipping of original artwork is on a piece by piece basis. I cannot give a set price for shipping, as it varies due to size of piece, weight, type of packaging needed, and your location. Your delivery choices and the option of insurance will also affect the price. I want to ensure that you pay no more than it actually costs, while getting the best service. I will prepare a quote for the artwork you have chosen, when you contact me, or when I get an order from PayPal. 
     		</li>
     		<li>
      		If you live in the Colorado front range area between Denver and Ft. Collins, I will provide delivery of original artwork to you for free, or for a minimal charge depending on distance.
     		</li>
     		<li>
      		Shipping of Limited Editions is via UPS, or USPS. Shipping charges are as stated on PayPal.
